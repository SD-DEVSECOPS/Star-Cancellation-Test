# ⭐ Star Cancellation Test (SCT)

This repository contains the **Star Cancellation Test** — a browser-based assessment tool used to measure visuospatial attention, perceptual accuracy, and motor control.  
It is commonly used in **neurological and neuropsychological research**, including studies on **spatial neglect** and related visuospatial disorders.

---

## 📌 Overview

The test displays **small & large stars, letters, and words** generated randomly across an interactive canvas.

**Participant task:**  
Draw a stroke over each **small star** they see.

The system automatically records:

- Correctly cancelled stars  
- **Cancellation order (first → last)**  
- **Stroke-by-stroke data**  
- **Stroke direction detection**  
  - Left→Right  
  - Right→Left  
  - Top→Bottom  
  - Bottom→Top  
- Left/right cancellation distribution  
- **Laterality Index**  
- **USN classification**  
- **Full statistical summary**  
- **CSV export** (UTF-8 BOM for Turkish characters)  
- **PNG export** of the final canvas state  

Researchers can configure object counts before starting the test:

| Object Type | Recommended Range |
|-------------|------------------|
| Small stars | 50–80            |
| Large stars | 50–70            |
| Letters     | 10–30            |
| Words       | 10–20            |

> ⚠ These values are validated to prevent excessive overlap or overload.

1. Adjust object counts (optional).  
2. Select test duration (minutes).  
3. Press **Start Test**.  
4. Participant draws strokes directly on the canvas to cancel stars.  
5. When the timer ends or **Finish Test** is pressed:
   - Statistics panel appears  
   - Cancellation order displayed  
   - Directional stroke table displayed  
   - Required participant info:
     - Name  
     - Surname  
     - Age  

6. Export results via:
   - **Download CSV**  
   - **Download PNG**
